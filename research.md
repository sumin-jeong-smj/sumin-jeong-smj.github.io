### **Bioinformatic Platform Development** 

- #### [Q-omics](https://qomics.io)

  - Multi-omics data mining software for research and drug discovery 

    ![image-qomicsOverview]({{site.url}}\images\qomics_overview.png)   ![image-qomicsMain]({{site.url}}\images\qomics_main.png)

  - Processed data to produce omics datasets and established code structure by modularizing core functionalities.
  - Led development of C++ extensions to achieve 60x faster computations for cross-association and survival analysis.
  - Generated pre-calculated datasets comprising billions of data pairs for advanced data mining applications.

- #### [NetCrafter](https://qomics.io/help_netcrafter.html)

  - Visualizing gene and function networks with representative functions

  - Derived thresholds of functional similarity scores through statistical distribution of random test outcomes. 
  - Evaluated practical effectiveness through authentic dataset application.
  - Trained a graphic neural network model to predict the efficacy of specific gene perturbations.

- #### [QStrain](https://qstrain.sookmyung.ac.kr/)

  - Identifying nucleic acid therapeutics targeting high-risk viral genomes

    ![image-qstrain_rna]({{site.url}}\images\qstrain_rna.png)![image-qstrain_structure]({{site.url}}\images\qstrain_structure.png)

  - Constructed a database for 54 virus subtypes from multiple sequence alignment & next-generation sequencing.
  - Designed modules for extracting homologous regions from MSA data and predicting therapeutic efficacy.


### **Integrative Omics Analysis Projects**

- #### Consensus Data Mining

  ![image-consensus_overview]({{site.url}}\images\consensus_overview.png)

  - Conducted consensus analysis with tumor-specific or prognostic genes, interpreting results.

  - Identified synthetic lethal target-biomarker pairs and verified them with patient survival and external data.

  - Analyzed high-consensus target-biomarker pairs by implementing functional networks from Gene Ontology.

    ![image-consensus_rep]({{site.url}}\images\consensus_rep.png)

  - Indicated greater reproducibility of high-consensus target-biomarker pairs across different analysis and datasets.

- #### siGPCR Library screening with Cisplatin

  - Assisted in collecting and analyzing patient data for cancer treatment survival studies.
